## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.x or later recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LaluPrasad-M/ecommerce-frontend.git
   cd ecommerce-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

4. The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Architecture and Design Choices

### Routing and Authentication

The application uses React Router v7 with protected routes to manage user access:

- `ProtectedRoute`: A component that redirects unauthenticated users to the login page
- `CustomerRoute`: Specific for customer-only routes, redirects admins to the admin dashboard
- Role-based navigation and UI rendering based on user role (admin/customer)

### State Management

Redux Toolkit is used for centralized state management:

- **Store Configuration**: Centralized in `src/app/store.ts`
- **Feature-based Organization**: State is divided into slices based on features (auth, products, cart, etc.)
- **Custom Hooks**: `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` for typed Redux hooks
- **Serialization**: Custom serialization configuration to handle non-serializable values

### API Integration

Axios is used for API communication with the following features:

- **Centralized Client**: Base configuration in `src/api/client.ts`
- **Interceptors**: Automatic token attachment and refresh handling
- **Service Pattern**: API calls grouped by domain in service files
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with notification dispatch
- **Authentication Events**: Custom events for authentication expiration

### UI Design

Material UI v7 is used for the component library with customizations:

- **Custom Theme**: Defined in `src/theme/index.ts` with light/dark mode support
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- **Component Structure**: Organized into shared, layout, and feature-specific components
- **Notification System**: Centralized notification system using Notistack/React-Toastify

### Form Handling

The application uses Formik with Yup for form validation:

- **Field Validation**: Form schemas defined with Yup for client-side validation
- **Form Submission**: Integration with Redux actions for form submission
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error display across forms

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization

The codebase follows several organizational principles:

1. **Feature-based Organization**: Code is primarily organized by feature, not by technical function
2. **Component Reusability**: Components are structured to maximize reusability
3. **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Complex components are often split into container/presentational components
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used throughout with strict type checking

### Adding New Features

When adding new features, follow these steps:

1. Define types in the appropriate file under `src/types/`
2. Create the Redux slice in `src/features/` if needed
3. Add API service methods in the appropriate service file
4. Create components in `src/components/`
5. Create pages in `src/pages/`
6. Add routes to `App.tsx` if necessary
7. Register new reducers in the store if needed

## Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized production files.

### Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration:

- Create a `.env` file in the project root for local development
- Set up environment variables in your deployment platform for production

Required environment variables:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: URL of the backend API
- `REACT_APP_VERSION`: Application version

### Deployment Options

- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repository and deploy automatically
  ```bash
  npm install -g vercel
  vercel
  ```
## Backend Integration

The frontend is designed to connect to a RESTful API backend. The API endpoints expected are:

- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/refresh`
- **Products**: `/api/products`, `/api/products/:id`
- **Cart**: `/api/cart`, `/api/cart/:id`
- **Orders**: `/api/orders`, `/api/orders/:id`
- **Admin**: `/api/admin/products`, `/api/admin/orders`, `/api/admin/coupons`
